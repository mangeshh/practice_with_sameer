Deprecated Lifecycle Methods:

>componentWillMount(): 
Invoked just before the component is rendered for the first time.

>componentDidMount(): 
Invoked immediately after the component is mounted (inserted into the DOM).

>componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps): 
Invoked when the component is about to receive new props from its parent component.

>componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState):
Invoked just before the component is updated and re-rendered.

>componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState): 
Invoked immediately after the component has been updated and re-rendered.

>componentWillUnmount(): Invoked just before the component is unmounted and destroyed.
Newer Lifecycle Hooks (Lifecycle Methods with Side Effects):

>> New lifecycle methods

>constructor(props): 
A special method used for initializing the component's state and binding event handlers.

>static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): 
Used to update the component's state based on changes in props.

>render(): 
Required method that returns the component's JSX markup.

>componentDidMount():
Invoked immediately after the component is mounted.

>shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState): 
Allows you to optimize rendering by determining if a re-render is necessary.

>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState): 
Used to capture information from the DOM before it gets potentially updated.

>componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot): 
Invoked immediately after the component has been updated.

>componentWillUnmount(): 
Invoked just before the component is unmounted.

Note that with the introduction of React Hooks in React 16.8, you can also use functional components and leverage additional lifecycle hooks like useEffect, useMemo, useCallback, etc., which allow you to perform side effects and manage state within functional components.

It's worth mentioning that the deprecated lifecycle methods are still supported in older React versions, but they are not recommended for use in new projects. The newer lifecycle hooks and functional components with hooks provide a more expressive and flexible way to handle component lifecycle and state management.
