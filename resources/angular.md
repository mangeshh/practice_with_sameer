To install NVM, npm, and Node.js in the correct sequence, follow these steps:

Install NVM (Node Version Manager):

Visit the official NVM repository on GitHub: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
Follow the installation instructions provided on the repository page to install NVM for your operating system.
Verify the installation by opening a new terminal window and running the command nvm --version. If NVM is installed correctly, it will display the version number.

Install Node.js using NVM:
Open a new terminal window (to ensure NVM changes take effect).
Use NVM to install the desired version of Node.js. For example, to install the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version, run the command nvm install --lts.
Verify the installation by running node --version to check the installed version of Node.js.
Verify npm installation:

Once you install Node, the npm will be available.

Run npm --version in the terminal to check if npm is already installed. If npm is not installed, it will display an error.
If npm is not installed, you can install it by updating Node.js. Run the following command to ensure npm is up to date: npm install -g npm.
By following this sequence, you first install NVM to manage multiple Node.js versions, then use NVM to install the desired version of Node.js, and finally verify the installation and update npm if necessary. This ensures a proper and functional setup of NVM, npm, and Node.js on your system.

after node is sinstalled do i have to install npm

No, you don't have to install npm separately after installing Node.js. When you install Node.js, npm (Node Package Manager) is automatically included as part of the installation. npm is bundled with Node.js and is available by default.

After you install Node.js, you can verify if npm is installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the command npm --version. If npm is properly installed, it will display the version number.

So, once you have installed Node.js, you already have npm installed and can start using it to manage packages and dependencies for your Node.js projects without any additional steps.
