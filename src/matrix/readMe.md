0          (0,1,2)    (0,1,2)     0
0          (0,1,2)    (0,1,2)     1

(a)row     (a)col     (b)row      (b)col
1          (0,1,2)    (0,1,2)     0
1          (0,1,2)    (0,1,2)     1

we see [atterm (a) col and (b) row are always same and iterating from 0 to n.
(a) row repeating same as number of rows in a or columns in b.
